            Overview
            Velocity is an animation engine with the same API as jQuery's $.animate(). It works with and without jQuery. It's incredibly fast, and it features color animation, transforms, loops, easings, SVG support, and scrolling. It is the best of jQuery and CSS transitions combined.
            Download
            Download Velocity, include it on your page, and replace all instances of jQuery's $.animate() with $.velocity(). You will immediately see a performance boost across all browsers and devices — especially on mobile.
            Compatibility
            Velocity works everywhere — back to IE8 and Android 2.3. Under the hood, it mimics jQuery's $.queue(), and thus interoperates seamlessly with jQuery's $.animate(), $.fade(), and $.delay(). Since Velocity's syntax is identical to $.animate(), your code doesn't need to change.
            Secret Sauce
            JavaScript and jQuery are falsely conflated. JavaScript animation, which Velocity uses, is fast; it's jQuery that's slow. Although Velocity works alongside jQuery, it uses its own animation stack that delivers its performance through two underlying principles: 1) synchronize the DOM → tween stack to minimize layout thrashing, and 2) cache values to minimize DOM querying.
